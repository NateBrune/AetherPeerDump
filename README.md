# AetherPeerDump
A temporary website created for the great peer discovery algorithm scare of '15

Hello, I made this website to sort out all the connectivity issues with Aether version 1.2.3

I know that the source is awful and undocumented, I feel the need to say it a couple more times.

###This source code is  awful and undocumented

I made it in the two hour span I had between discovering Aether and going to work. I didnt feel like setting up a mysql database so I am using a library called simple_html_dom to do some black magic. I am seriously sorry. I hope to later implement an ajax polling system so that on page load it will tell you which peers are actually online. Until then, you have a list of peers that at one point where successfully port forwarded and online.

[here is the website](http://aether.mygen.ca/index.php)

Feel free to leave issues or do whatever you need to do.
